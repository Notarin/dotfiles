The Code Line Expansion Navigator is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance code readability and navigation within a single logical line of code, often spanning multiple chained methods or functions. It integrates with the Language Server Protocol (LSP) to provide an interactive dropdown menu, allowing users to explore and interact with individual symbols, method calls, and constructs that constitute a complex line of code.
